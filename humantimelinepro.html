          <p><b>Why the timeline from Cosmo begins has something to do with covid-19 or us? </b></p> 
        </center>
<p>Earth is <b>4.5 billion</b> years old. In just a fraction of that time, 
  one species among countless others has conquered it: which is us.</p>

  <p>  Basically this page opens up with the origin of organisms from simple phenomena like energy, matter, 
    atoms and molecules. The chronological explanation given in this chapter regarding the coming of organisms into existence,
     confirm that organisms including Homo sapiens evolved from simple organisms into complex organisms. </p>
  <p>Ostensibly, the sapiens appeared the most intelligent organisms, and that explains why they formed their own cultures and later became 
    in charge of other organisms. </p>
  <p>Besides, the presentation of systematic developments or revolution of human cultures and 
    societies presents evolution as an ongoing process. As a result, this convinces that organisms originated from simple organisms to become complex 
    organisms. This pictures humankind evolution as a process that is gradual, but makes tremendous transformations to human life.</p>

<p>Few things you need to know before reading below. Look at your left side üëà or top ‚òùÔ∏è (Phone) that's the 
  <b>sidebar</b> you can scroll to a different timeline from Cosmological
   beginnings until to the year <a href="#covid-19">2020 Covid 19</a> which is the Planetary Management era"</p>

   <p>Hence, below every <a href="#image">image</a>  and <a href="#table">table</a> are 
    able to scroll for more pictures and specific years of events happening on every events.</p>

     <p>If you would like to come back on top of the page just tab and click üëà or top ‚òùÔ∏è (Phone) on the left top "TIMELINE"</p>

     <p>I Hope you enjoy my page and get most of the knowledge from that i have gathered, cheers!</p>

          <p><b>ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER,</b> energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called <b>"Physics"</b>. </p> 
        
        
          <p>About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. 
                
            The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called <b>Chemistry</b>."</p>
            
            <p>About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. 
            
              The story of organisms is called <b>"Biology"</b>.</p>
            
        <p>About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiensstarted to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. 
            
            The subsequent development of these human cultures is called <b>"History"</b>.</p>
        
            
           <p> <b>Three</b> important revolutions shaped the course of history: </p>
            
          <p> <b>The Cognitive Revolution </b> kick-started history about <b>70,000</b> years ago. </p>
            
           <p> <b>The Agricultural Revolution</b> sped it up about <b>12,000</b> years ago. </p>
            
           <p> <b style="color:red;">The Scientific Revolution</b>, which got under way only <b style="color: red;">500 years ago</b>, may well end history and start something completely different. </p>

        <center> <p> <b>Myth</b></p> </center>
        <p>Our chimpanzee cousins usually live in small troops of several dozen individuals. 
          They form close friendships, hunt together and fight shoulder to shoulder against baboons, 
          cheetahs and enemy chimpanzees. Their social structure tends to be hierarchical. The dominant member, 
          who is almost always a male, is termed the ‚Äòalpha male‚Äô. Other males and females exhibit their submission to 
          the alpha male by bowing before him while making grunting sounds, not unlike human subjects kowtowing before a king. 
          The alpha male strives to maintain social harmony within his troop. When two individuals fight, he will intervene and 
          stop the violence. Less benevolently, he might monopolise particularly coveted foods and prevent lower-ranking males from 
          mating with the females.</p>

          <p>When two males are contesting the alpha position, they usually do so by forming extensive coalitions of supporters, 
            both male and female, from within the group. Ties between coalition members are based on intimate daily contact ‚Äì hugging, 
            touching, kissing, grooming and mutual favours. Just as human politicians on election campaigns go around shaking hands and 
            kissing babies, so aspirants to the top position in a chimpanzee group spend much time hugging, back-slapping and kissing baby 
            chimps. The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable 
            coalition. These coalitions play a central part not only during overt struggles for the alpha position, but in almost all 
            day-to-day activities. Members of a coalition spend more time together, share food, and help one another in times of trouble.</p>
        
            <p>There are clear limits to the size of groups that can be formed and maintained in such a way. In order to function, 
              all members of a group must know each other intimately. Two chimpanzees who have never met, never fought, and never engaged 
              in mutual grooming will not know whether they can trust one another, whether it would be worthwhile to help one another, and 
              which of them ranks higher. Under natural conditions, a typical chimpanzee troop consists of about twenty to fifty individuals. 
              As the number of chimpanzees in a troop increases, the social order destabilises, eventually leading to a rupture and the formation
               of a new troop by some of the animals. Only in a handful of cases have zoologists observed groups larger than a hundred. Separate 
               groups seldom cooperate, and tend to compete for territory and food. Researchers have documented prolonged warfare between groups,
                and even one case of ‚Äògenocidal‚Äô activity in which one troop systematically slaughtered most members of a neighbouring band.</p>

<p>Similar patterns probably dominated the social lives of early humans, including archaic Homo sapiens. Humans, 
  like chimps, have social instincts that enabled our ancestors to form friendships and hierarchies, and to hunt or fight 
  together. However, like the social instincts of chimps, those of humans were adapted only for small intimate groups. When 
  the group grew too large, its social order destabilised and the band split. Even if a particularly fertile valley could feed 
  500 archaic Sapiens, there was no way that so many strangers could live together. How could they agree who should be leader, who 
  should hunt where, or who should mate with whom?</p>


  <p>In the wake of the Cognitive Revolution, <span class="redwords">gossip</span> helped Homo sapiens to form larger and
     more stable bands. But even gossip has its <span class="redwords">limits</span>. Sociological research has shown that the <span class="redwords">maximum</span>  
     ‚Äònatural‚Äô size of a group bonded by gossip is about <span class="redwords">150 individuals</span>. Most people can neither intimately know
     , nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings.</p>

     <p>Even today, a critical threshold in human organisations falls somewhere around this magic number. Below this threshold, 
       communities, businesses, social networks and military units can maintain themselves based mainly on intimate acquaintance and 
       rumour-mongering. There is no need for formal ranks, titles and law books to keep order.3 A platoon of thirty soldiers or even a 
       company of a hundred soldiers can function well on the basis of intimate relations, with a minimum of formal discipline. 
       A well-respected sergeant can become ‚Äòking of the company and exercise authority even over commissioned officers. A small 
       family business can survive and flourish without a board of directors, a CEO or an accounting department.</p>

       <p>But once the threshold of <span class="redwords">150 individuals is crossed</span>, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division
          with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when 
          they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.</p>

          <p><span class="redwords">How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold</span>, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands 
            of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers 
            of strangers can cooperate successfully by <span class="redwords">believing in common myths</span>.</p>

            <p>Any large-scale human cooperation ‚Äì whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe
               ‚Äì is rooted in common myths that exist only in peoples collective imagination. Churches are rooted in common religious 
               myths. Two Catholics who have never met can nevertheless go together on crusade or pool funds to build a hospital because 
               they both believe that God was incarnated in human flesh and allowed Himself to be crucified to redeem our sins. States 
               are rooted in common national myths. Two Serbs who have never met might risk their lives to save one another because both
                believe in the existence of the Serbian nation, the Serbian homeland and the Serbian flag. Judicial systems are rooted in
                 common legal myths. Two lawyers who have never met can nevertheless combine efforts to defend a complete stranger because 
                 they both believe in the existence of laws, justice, human rights ‚Äì and the money paid out in fees.</p>

            <center> <p> <b>The Domestication of Fire </b></p> </center>
            
            <p>A significant step on the way to the top was the domestication of fire. Some human species may have made occasional use of fire as early as 800,000 years ago. Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.

            <p>Humans now had a dependable source of light and warmth, and a deadly weapon against prowling lions. Not long afterwards, humans may even have started deliberately to torch their neighbourhoods. A carefully managed fire could turn impassable barren thickets into prime grasslands teeming with game. In addition, once the fire died down, Stone Age entrepreneurs could walk through the smoking remains and harvest charcoaled animals, nuts and tubers.</p>
            <p>But the best thing fire did was cook. Foods that humans cannot digest in their natural forms ‚Äì such as wheat, rice and potatoes ‚Äì became staples of our diet thanks to cooking. Fire not only changed food‚Äôs chemistry, it changed its biology as well. Cooking killed germs and parasites that infested food. Humans also had a far easier time chewing and digesting old favourites such as fruits, nuts, insects and carrion if they were cooked. Whereas chimpanzees spend five hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food.</p>
            <p>The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it‚Äôs hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.
</p>
            
            <p>Fire also opened the first significant gulf between man and the other animals. The power of almost all animals depends on their bodies: the strength of their muscles, the size of their teeth, the breadth of their wings. Though they may harness winds and currents, they are unable to control these natural forces, and are always constrained by their physical design. Eagles, for example, identify thermal columns rising from the ground, spread their giant wings and allow the hot air to lift them upwards. Yet eagles cannot control the location of the columns, and their maximum carrying capacity is strictly proportional to their wingspan.
</p> <p>When humans domesticated fire, they gained control of an obedient and potentially limitless force. Unlike eagles, humans could choose when and where to ignite a flame, and they were able to exploit fire for any number of tasks. Most importantly, the power of fire was not limited by the form, structure or strength of the human body. A single woman with a flint or fire stick could burn down an entire forest in a matter of hours. The domestication of fire was a sign of things to come.

   <p> <b>History's biggest fraud.</b></p>
  </center>
           
          <p>FOR 2.5 MILLION YEARS HUMANS FED themselves by gathering plants and hunting animals that lived and bred without 
            their intervention. Homo erectus, Homo ergaster and the Neanderthals plucked wild figs and hunted wild sheep without 
            deciding where fig trees would take root, in which meadow a herd of sheep should graze, or which billy goat would 
            inseminate which nanny goat. Homo sapiens spread from East Africa to the Middle East, to Europe and Asia, and 
            finally to Australia and America ‚Äì but everywhere they went, Sapiens too continued to live by gathering wild 
            plants and hunting wild animals. Why do anything else when your lifestyle feeds you amply and supports a rich 
            world of social structures, religious beliefs and political dynamics?</p>
       

            <p>All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to 
              manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered 
              plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide 
              them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived ‚Äì the Agricultural Revolution.</p>

            <p>The transition to agriculture began around 9500‚Äì8500 BC in the hill country of south-eastern Turkey, western Iran, 
              and the Levant. It began slowly and in a restricted geographical area. Wheat and goats were domesticated by approximately 
              9000 BC; peas and lentils around 8000 BC; olive trees by 5000 BC; horses by 4000 BC; and grapevines in 3500 BC. Some animals 
              and plants, such as camels and cashew nuts, were domesticated even later, but by 3500 BC the main wave of domestication 
              was over. Even today, with all our advanced technologies, more than 90 per cent of the calories that feed humanity come 
              from the handful of plants that our ancestors domesticated between 9500 and 3500 BC ‚Äì wheat, rice, maize (called ‚Äòcorn‚Äô 
              in the US), potatoes, millet and barley. No noteworthy plant or animal has been domesticated in the last 2,000 years. 
              If our minds are those of hunter-gatherers, our cuisine is that of ancient farmers.</p>
         
         
          <p> Scholars once believed that agriculture spread from a single Middle Eastern point of origin to the four corners of the world. 
            Today, scholars agree that agriculture sprang up in other parts of the world not by the action of Middle Eastern farmers exporting 
            their revolution but entirely independently. People in Central America domesticated maize and beans without knowing anything 
            about wheat and pea cultivation in the Middle East. South Americans learned how to raise potatoes and llamas, unaware of what 
            was going on in either Mexico or the Levant. Chinas first revolutionaries domesticated rice, millet and pigs. North America‚Äôs 
            first gardeners were those who got tired of combing the undergrowth for edible gourds and decided to cultivate pumpkins. 
            New Guineans tamed sugar cane and bananas, while the first West African farmers made African millet, African rice, sorghum 
            and wheat conform to their needs. From these initial focal points, agriculture spread far and wide. By the first century 
            AD the vast majority of people throughout most of the world were agriculturists.</p>
          

          <p>Why did agricultural revolutions erupt in the Middle East, China and Central America but not in Australia, Alaska or South 
            Africa? The reason is simple: most species of plants and animals can‚Äôt be domesticated. Sapiens could dig up delicious truffles 
            and hunt down woolly mammoths, but domesticating either species was out of the question. The fungi were far too elusive, 
            the giant beasts too ferocious. Of the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitable 
            candidates for farming and herding. Those few species lived in particular places, and those are the places where agricultural 
            revolutions occurred.

            Scholars once proclaimed that the agricultural revolution was a great leap forward for humanity. They told a tale of progress 
            fuelled by human brain power. Evolution gradually produced ever more intelligent people. Eventually, people were so smart that 
            they were able to decipher nature‚Äôs secrets, enabling them to tame sheep and cultivate wheat. As soon as this happened, 
            they cheerfully abandoned the gruelling, dangerous, and often spartan life of hunter-gatherers, settling down to enjoy 
            the pleasant, satiated life of farmers.</p>

            <p>That tale is a fantasy. There is no evidence that people became more intelligent with time. Foragers knew the secrets of 
              nature long before the Agricultural Revolution, since their survival depended on an intimate knowledge of the animals they 
              hunted and the plants they gathered. Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers 
              with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more 
              stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly 
              enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet 
              or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder 
              than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history‚Äôs biggest fraud.</p>

              <p>Who was responsible? Neither kings, nor priests, nor merchants. The culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, 
                rice and potatoes. <span class="redwords">These plants domesticated Homo sapiens, rather than vice versa.</span> </p>

                <p>Think for a moment about the Agricultural Revolution from the viewpoint of wheat. Ten thousand years ago wheat was just a wild grass, 
                  one of many, confined to a small range in the Middle East. Suddenly, within just a few short millennia, it was growing all over the 
                  world. According to the basic evolutionary criteria of survival and reproduction, wheat has become one of the most successful 
                  plants in the history of the earth. In areas such as the Great Plains of North America, where not a single wheat stalk grew 
                  10,000 years ago, you can today walk for hundreds upon hundreds of kilometres without encountering any other plant. 
                  Worldwide, wheat covers about 2.25 million square kilometres of the globes surface, almost ten times the size of Britain. 
                  How did this grass turn from insignificant to ubiquitous?</p>

                  <p>Wheat did it by manipulating Homo sapiens to its advantage. This ape had been living a fairly comfortable life hunting and 
                    gathering until about 10,000 years ago, but then began to invest more and more effort in cultivating wheat. Within a couple 
                    of millennia, humans in many parts of the world were doing little from dawn to dusk other than taking care of wheat plants. 
                    It wasn‚Äôt easy. Wheat demanded a lot of them. Wheat didn‚Äôt like rocks and pebbles, so Sapiens broke their backs clearing 
                    fields. Wheat didn‚Äôt like sharing its space, water and nutrients with other plants, so men and women laboured long days 
                    weeding under the scorching sun. Wheat got sick, so Sapiens had to keep a watch out for worms and blight. Wheat was 
                    defenceless against other organisms that liked to eat it, from rabbits to locust swarms, so the farmers had to 
                    guard and protect it. Wheat was thirsty, so humans lugged water from springs and streams to water it. Its 
                    hunger even impelled Sapiens to collect animal faeces to nourish the ground in which wheat grew.</p>
          
                    <p>The body of Homo sapiens had not evolved for such tasks. It was adapted to climbing apple trees and running after gazelles, 
                      not to clearing rocks and carrying water buckets. Human spines, knees, necks and arches paid the price. Studies of 
                      ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such 
                      as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time 
                      that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed 
                      their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us. The word ‚Äòdomesticate‚Äô 
                      comes from the Latin domus, which means ‚Äòhouse‚Äô. Who‚Äôs the one living in a house? Not 
                      the wheat. It‚Äôs the Sapiens.</p>

                      <p>How did wheat convince Homo sapiens to exchange a rather good life for a more miserable existence? What did it offer in return? 
                        It did not offer a better diet. Remember, humans are omnivorous apes who thrive on a wide variety of foods. Grains made up 
                        only a small fraction of the human diet before the Agricultural Revolution. A diet based on cereals is poor in minerals 
                        and vitamins, hard to digest, and really bad for your teeth and gums.</p>

                        <p>Wheat did not give people economic security. The life of a peasant is less secure than that of a hunter-gatherer. 
                          Foragers relied on dozens of species to survive, and could therefore weather difficult years even without stocks 
                          of preserved food. If the availability of one species was reduced, they could gather and hunt more of other 
                          species. Farming societies have, until very recently, relied for the great bulk of their calorie intake on 
                          a small variety of domesticated plants. In many areas, they relied on just a single staple, such as wheat, 
                          potatoes or rice. If the rains failed or clouds of locusts arrived or if a fungus learned how to infect 
                          that staple species, peasants died by the thousands and millions.</p>

<p>Nor could wheat offer security against human violence. The early farmers were at least as violent as their forager 
  ancestors, if not more so. Farmers had more possessions and needed land for planting. The loss of pasture land to 
  raiding neighbours could mean the difference between subsistence and starvation, so there was much less room for 
  compromise. When a foraging band was hard-pressed by a stronger rival, it could usually move on. It was difficult 
  and dangerous, but it was feasible. When a strong enemy threatened an agricultural village, retreat meant giving 
  up fields, houses and granaries. In many cases, this doomed the refugees to starvation. Farmers, therefore, 
  tended to stay put and fight to the bitter end.</p>

    <p class="smallwords">Tribal warfare in New Guinea between two farming communities (1960). Such scenes were probably widespread in 
      the thousands of years following the Agricultural Revolution.</p> 
  </center>

 <p>Many anthropological and archaeological studies indicate that in simple agricultural societies with no political frameworks beyond village and tribe, 
   human violence was responsible for about 15 per cent of deaths, including 25 per cent of male deaths. In contemporary New Guinea, violence accounts 
   for 30 per cent of male deaths in one agricultural tribal society, the Dani, and 35 per cent in another, the Enga. In Ecuador, perhaps 50 per cent 
   of adult Waoranis meet a violent death at the hands of another human!3 In time, human violence was brought under control through the development 
   of larger social frameworks ‚Äì cities, kingdoms and states. But it took thousands of years to build such huge and effective political structures.</p>

   <p>Village life certainly brought the first farmers some immediate benefits, such as better protection against wild animals, rain and cold. Yet for 
     the average person, the disadvantages probably outweighed the advantages. This is hard for people in today‚Äôs prosperous societies to appreciate. 
     Since we enjoy affluence and security, and since our affluence and security are built on foundations laid by the Agricultural Revolution, we 
     assume that the Agricultural Revolution was a wonderful improvement. Yet it is wrong to judge thousands of years of history from the perspective 
     of today. A much more representative viewpoint is that of a three-year-old girl dying from malnutrition in first-century China because her 
     father‚Äôs crops have failed. Would she say ‚ÄòI am dying from malnutrition, but in 2,000 years, people will have plenty to eat and live in big 
     air-conditioned houses, so my suffering is a worthwhile sacrifice‚Äô?</p>

     <p>What then did wheat offer agriculturists, including that malnourished Chinese girl? It offered nothing for people as individuals. Yet it did 
       bestow something on Homo sapiens as a species. Cultivating wheat provided much more food per unit of territory, and thereby enabled Homo 
       sapiensto multiply exponentially. Around 13,000 BC, when people fed themselves by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals, the 
       area around the oasis of Jericho, in Palestine, could support at most one roaming band of about a hundred relatively healthy and 
       well-nourished people. Around 8500 BC, when wild plants gave way to wheat fields, the oasis supported a large but cramped 
       village of 1,000 people, who suffered far more from disease and malnourishment.</p>
  
       <p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company 
         is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success 
         of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a 
         company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. 
         From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the 
         Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

         <p>Yet why should individuals care about this evolutionary calculus? Why would any sane person lower his or her standard of living just to 
           multiply the number of copies of the Homo sapiens genome? Nobody agreed to this deal: the Agricultural Revolution was a trap.</p>

        <p>The first empire about which we have definitive information was the <span class="redwords">Akkadian Empire</span> of Sargon the Great (c.2250 BC). 
          Sargon began his career as the <span class="redwords">king of Kish</span>, a small city state in Mesopotamia. Within a few decades he managed to conquer
           not only all other Mesopotamian city states, but also large territories outside the Mesopotamian heartland. Sargon  
           <span class="redwords">boasted</span>
           that he had conquered the  
                      <span class="redwords">entire world.</span>

           
           In reality, his dominion stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, and 
           included most of today‚Äôs Iraq and Syria, along with a few slices of modern Iran and Turkey.</p>
        
           <p>The Akkadian Empire did not last long after its founder‚Äôs death, but Sargon left behind an imperial mantle that seldom 
             remained unclaimed. For the next 1,700 years, Assyrian, Babylonian and Hittite kings adopted Sargon as a role model, 
             <span class="redwords">boasting</span> that they, too, had conquered the <span class="redwords">entire world</span>. Then, around 550 BC, Cyrus the Great of Persia came along with 
             an even more impressive boast.  </p>

            <center>
             <img class="image-in-words" src="https://erenow.net/common/sapiensbriefhistory/sapiensbriefhistory.files/image037.jpg"   alt="map">
            </center>
        
             <p>The kings of Assyria always remained the kings of Assyria. Even when they claimed to rule the entire world, it was 
               obvious that they were doing it for the greater glory of Assyria, and they were not apologetic about it. Cyrus, on the 
               other hand, claimed not merely to rule the whole world, but to do so for the sake of all people. ‚ÄòWe are conquering you 
               for your own benefit,‚Äô said the Persians. Cyrus wanted the peoples he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky 
               to be Persian vassals. The most famous example of Cyrus‚Äô innovative efforts to gain the approbation of a nation living under 
               the thumb of his empire was his command that the Jewish exiles in Babylonia be allowed to return to their Judaean homeland 
               and rebuild their temple. He even offered them financial assistance. Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over 
               Jews ‚Äì he was also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare.</p>

               <p>The presumption to rule the entire world for the benefit of all its inhabitants was startling. Evolution has made Homo 
                 sapiens, like other social mammals, a xenophobic creature. Sapiens instinctively divide humanity into two parts, ‚Äòwe‚Äô and 
                 ‚Äòthey‚Äô. We are people like you and me, who share our language, religion and customs. We are all responsible for each other, 
                 but not responsible for them. We were always distinct from them, and owe them nothing. We don‚Äôt want to see any of them in 
                 our territory, and we don‚Äôt care an iota what happens in their territory. They are barely even human. In the language of the 
                 Dinka people of the Sudan, ‚ÄòDinka‚Äô simply means ‚Äòpeople‚Äô. People who are not Dinka are not people. The Dinka‚Äôs bitter enemies 
                 are the Nuer. What does the word Nuer mean in Nuer language? It means ‚Äòoriginal people‚Äô. Thousands of kilometres from the 
                 Sudan deserts, in the frozen ice-lands of Alaska and north-eastern Siberia, live the Yupiks. What does Yupik mean in Yupik 
                 language? It means ‚Äòreal people‚Äô.</p>

                 <p>In contrast with this ethnic exclusiveness, imperial ideology from Cyrus onward has tended to be inclusive and all-encompassing. 
                   Even though it has often emphasised racial and cultural differences between rulers and ruled, it has still recognised the basic 
                   unity of the <span class="redwords">entire world</span>, the existence of a single set of principles governing all places and times, and the mutual 
                   responsibilities of all human beings. Humankind is seen as a large family: the privileges of the parents go hand in hand with 
                   responsibility for the welfare of the children.</p>
                   <span class="redwords"></span>
                   <p>This new imperial vision passed from Cyrus and the Persians to Alexander the Great, and from him to Hellenistic kings, 
                     Roman emperors, Muslim caliphs, Indian dynasts, and eventually even to Soviet premiers and American presidents. This benevolent 
                     imperial vision has justified the existence of empires, and negated not only attempts by subject peoples to rebel, but also 
                     attempts by independent peoples to resist imperial expansion.</p>

                     <p>Similar imperial visions were developed independently of the Persian model in other parts of the world, most notably in Central 
                       America, in the Andean region, and in China. According to traditional Chinese political theory, <span class="redwords">Heaven (Tian)</span>  is the source of 
                       all legitimate authority on earth. Heaven chooses the most worthy person or family and gives them the Mandate of Heaven. 
                       This person or family then rules over All <span class="redwords">Under Heaven Â§©‰∏ã (Tianxia)</span> for the benefit of all its inhabitants. Thus, a legitimate 
                       authority is ‚Äì by definition ‚Äì universal. If a ruler lacks the Mandate of Heaven, then he lacks legitimacy to rule even a 
                       single city. If a ruler enjoys the mandate, he is obliged to spread justice and harmony to the entire world. The Mandate 
                       of Heaven could not be given to several candidates simultaneously, and consequently one could not legitimise the existence 
                       of more than one independent state.</p>

                       <p>The first emperor of the united Chinese empire, Q√≠n Sh«ê Hu√°ngd√¨, <span class="redwords">boasted</span> that ‚Äòthroughout the six directions [of the universe] 
                         everything belongs to the emperor ‚Ä¶ wherever there is a human footprint, there is not one who did not become a 
                         subject [of the emperor] ‚Ä¶ his kindness reaches even oxen and horses. There is not one who did not benefit. Every man 
                         is safe under his own roof.‚Äô4 In Chinese political thinking as well as Chinese historical memory, imperial periods were 
                         henceforth seen as golden ages of order and justice. In contradiction to the modern Western view that a just world 
                         is composed of separate nation states, in China periods of political fragmentation were seen as dark ages of chaos 
                         and injustice. This perception has had far-reaching implications for Chinese history. Every time an empire collapsed, 
                         the dominant political theory goaded the powers that be not to settle for paltry independent principalities, but to 
                         attempt reunification. Sooner or later these attempts always succeeded.</p>
